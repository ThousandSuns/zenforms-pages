## Stylesheets

Styles are based on the ```Boostrap``` library, which is implemented using ```SCSS``` as a preprocessor by ```@extend```-ing the classes.

## Javascript

```jQuery``` is the main javascript library, which is a dependency of ```Boostrap``` as well as other javascript frameworks which may be implemented in the future.

## Task Runner

Tasks are run using the command line tool ```Gulp```.

See ```gulpfile.js``` for  details.
